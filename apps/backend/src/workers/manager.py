"""Worker management utilities for monitoring and health checks.

This module provides utilities for managing Celery workers, checking their
health, and monitoring worker status.

Usage:
    ```python
    from .workers.manager import check_worker_health, get_worker_status

    # Check if workers are healthy
    health = await check_worker_health()

    # Get worker status
    status = get_worker_status()
    ```
